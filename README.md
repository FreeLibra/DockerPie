# DockerPie

This Project started at Dec 23 , 2017

Hello,This is my first project on the Github!
# The Method and Idea in this Project 
This project general purpose is to control the Docker Images , Containers ,and Docker Machines etc ,
whether local or remote ,with simple GUI powered by Python  Tornado and BootStrap.
I try to communicate the docker engine by theses methods:
1. Input with system command with the python package named 'subprocess';
2. docker API with python package named 'docker';
3. Maybe,In the Future, I will use golang to communicate with the docker engine.

When I get those output,I will render the output results with web page to the customer,
by using BootStrap, JS , Ajax, Echarts ,WebSocket and etc. 

# Thank you for watching my project!
